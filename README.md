# Autonomous Mobile Robots

This repository contains an implementation of the Autonomous Mobile Robots course for ROCV master's program at Innopolis University. The course is instructed by [Geesara Prathap](https://github.com/GPrathap). So, this repository contains the course material besides my solutions for the assignments. In addition, I developed a PD controller for the differential drive robot. 

The course contents includes:
- Motion control (Kinematics, control, and dubins path planning).
- Estimation (Kalman filter, extended kalman filter, particle filter).
- Localization (Monte carlo, and ekf localization).
